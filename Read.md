1.What is the difference between getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and querySelector / querySelectorAll?
    sol:
   1) getElementById() is used to find one specific element using its id. Since an id is unique, it gives only one element.

   2) getElementsByClassName() is used to get all elements that have the same class name. It returns multiple elements.

   3) querySelector() selects the first element that matches a CSS selector.

   4) querySelectorAll() selects all elements that match a CSS selector.

In Short:

ID => one element

Class => many elements

querySelector => first match

querySelectorAll => all matches
